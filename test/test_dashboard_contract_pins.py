"""Regression pins for dashboard contracts that are currently carried by convention.

Each test here asserts an invariant the code already satisfies, so none of them changes
behaviour. They exist because each invariant is enforced by agreement between two places
that nothing checks: a default in two request handlers, a key set against two save sites,
and a filename derivation against the set that enumerates it.
